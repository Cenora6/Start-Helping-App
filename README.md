## Description
An app, which you can use to donate your old books, games, clothes etc. to others.

You can register and login to your own account, where you fill a form. There you can choose what you can give to other, how many bags you will use to pack the things, choose a city or organization/fundation, choose who you want to help and write your address with details for a courier. Every filled form is saved in the firebase database. You can also check your own statistics, how many bags you gave and how many organizations you supported.
